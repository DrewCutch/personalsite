## About the Author

I am a junior at The University of Southern California majoring in computer science. I began programming 7 years ago for my school's competition robotics team. Since then, I have worked on various personal projects including mobile apps, websites and desktop applications. I am by no means an expert in the field of computer science, but I hope that in writing this blog I can help to educate others and myself.
